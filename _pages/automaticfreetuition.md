This is a compilation of large scholarship awards that are automatically awarded. The awards included in this list meet the following criteria:

1. Awarded automatically based on GPA, SAT, ACT, and/or class rank
2. At least Full Tuition in magnitude (or equivalent)
3. Open to all US students, regardless of state residency, ethnicity, race, etc.
4. No need-based requirement or component
5. College must be accredited, public or non-profit private, 4-year degree-granting institution

Key:

* Full Tuition: covers the cost of tuition for 4 years
* Full Ride: covers Tuition, Room, and Board for 4 years (may include other benefits as well)
* exp: stipend for experiential learning (internship, study abroad, etc., allowable uses vary by college), occasionally living cost stipend
* Most Tuition: In certain cases, we have included scholarships that cover most of the cost to attend the institution

Where published, the application deadline for receiving the scholarships is included. In many cases, no deadline is published as the standard deadline for application for admission applies. Some deadlines are “Priority” deadlines, so awards after the deadline may still be possible. Some schools give awards on a first-come, first-served basis as funds are available. Information about school policies can be found on their scholarship websites.

Note: This page's content was largely stolen from [this site](http://automaticfulltuition.yolasite.com), which I replicated and updated in order to provide accurate information. Verifying and updating each scholarship's information will take time. This is a work in progress. You may refer to the original site until this is finished, though be sure to verify the information on the college's website.
