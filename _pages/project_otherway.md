The Other Way is a virtual reality bicycling experience built for the HTC Vive. I worked as a game designer and programmer on a team of five to design and develop The Other Way in two weeks.

### Bicycle Mechanics

The bicycle mechanics used two HTV Vive trackers to detect handlebar rotation and pedaling.
