Pollen Nation is an asymmetrical, multiplayer, virtual reality and controller-driven game built for the HTC Vive and PC. I worked as a game designer and programmer on a team of five to design and develop it in three weeks.

It's the Kentucky Derby of the bug world. A praying mantis, embodied by a player in a VR headset, takes on three bees, controlled by three Xbox controller players. The bees' goal is to work together to pollinate all of the flowers in the arena before the timer reaches zero, and the mantis's goal is to stop them. At the mantis's disposal are magical Venus flytrap seeds that can be thrown to slow the bees down.

### Design
The team went through multiple iterations informed by prototypes and playtests before we reached our final product. From the beginning, we set out to design an asymmetrical game with one player in a VR headset and *n* players using Xbox controllers. 

#### Stage 1: Ideation

From boxing worlds and angry mobs to a praying mantis a riding circus phoenix to escape an evil ringmaster, we explored many different worlds before arriving at a mantis versus bees pollination experience. 

Most of our original ideas involved a stationary VR player riding and controlling a flying animal while fending off a mob of angry bees by punching and shielding. We removed the player's control of the flying animal early on in fear that the multitasking would be too overwhelming.
