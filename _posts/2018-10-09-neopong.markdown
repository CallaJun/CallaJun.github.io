Neopong is a physically demanding hybrid of games like Pong and Breakout built on the Kinect. I worked as a game designer and programmer on a team of five to design and develop Neopong in just one week. 

* Personal Contributions
	* Worked in an interdisciplinary team to design a Kinect 2 game
	* Developed the game using C# in the Unity Game Engine with another programmer
	* Wrote scripts to handle paddle and ball behavior, crystals, and goals
	* Handled sequence of events throughout the experience
