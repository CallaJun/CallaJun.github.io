Hello. I'm a graduate student at the [Entertainment Technology Center](http://www.etc.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). A few random highlights:

- I graduated from [Bryn Mawr College](https://www.brynmawr.edu) with a degree in computer science.
- While there, I founded [Sudo Hoot](https://sudohoot.com), Bryn Mawr's student computer science organization
- I organized a hackathon at the White House. In 2015, I helped the Obama Administration develop and organize the first [White House CS Tech Jam](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/12/08/administration-kicks-participation-computer-science-education-week) as part of Computer Science Education Week.
