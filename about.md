Hello. I'm a graduate student at the [Entertainment Technology Center](http://www.etc.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). A few random highlights:

- I graduated from [Bryn Mawr College](https://www.brynmawr.edu) with a degree in computer science.
- While there, I founded [Sudo Hoot](https://sudohoot.com), Bryn Mawr's student computer science organization
- I organized a hackathon at the White House. In 2015, I helped the Obama Administration develop and organize the first [White House CS Tech Jam](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2015/12/08/administration-kicks-participation-computer-science-education-week) as part of Computer Science Education Week.
- I make zipper pouches with Skittles wrappers and sell them on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Cloversea).
- I am not done writing filling this website with content and am open to suggestions.
